# Issue #1 Completion Report: Docker Compose Stack Integration - API Service

## Summary
Successfully integrated the content-automation-api service into the Docker Compose stack orchestration system. Optimized the existing Dockerfile for improved health checks and build verification, removing external dependencies while maintaining robust container monitoring capabilities.

## Implementation Details

### Files Created/Modified
- `Dockerfile` - Optimized health check implementation using Node.js instead of curl dependency
- `CHANGELOG.md` - Added entries for Docker Compose stack integration and Dockerfile optimizations

### Key Features Implemented
- **Health Check Optimization**: Replaced curl-based health checks with Node.js HTTP requests to eliminate external dependencies
- **Build Verification**: Enhanced Dockerfile with better build verification steps
- **Stack Integration**: Configured service for seamless integration with Docker Compose orchestration
- **Port Configuration**: Standardized on port 3000 for API service within the stack

### Technical Decisions
- **Node.js Health Checks**: Chose to use Node.js built-in HTTP module instead of curl to reduce image size and eliminate external dependencies
- **Alpine Base Image**: Maintained Node.js 22 Alpine base for optimal security and performance
- **Non-root User**: Preserved security hardening with dedicated application user
- **Health Check Interval**: Configured appropriate health check timing for stack orchestration

## Testing Results
- **Container Build**: ✅ Successfully builds without errors
- **Health Checks**: ✅ Health endpoint responds correctly at `/health`
- **Stack Integration**: ✅ Service starts and integrates properly with Docker Compose stack
- **Port Accessibility**: ✅ API accessible on localhost:3000 when stack is running
- **Service Dependencies**: ✅ Properly configured dependencies within the stack

## Documentation Updates
- [x] CHANGELOG.md updated with Docker Compose integration entries
- [x] Completion report created documenting implementation details
- [ ] README.md may need updates for stack-specific deployment instructions (future enhancement)

## Next Steps
- Monitor service performance within the stack environment
- Address MCP ingestion service health issues (documented in separate issue report)
- Consider adding environment-specific configuration for different deployment scenarios
- Evaluate need for additional monitoring and logging integration
